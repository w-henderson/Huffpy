# Huffpy
Huffpy is a simple and efficient Huffman coding library for Python. It was written for a school project but I've since developed it further into a proper robust Python library.

## What is Huffman coding?
Huffman coding is a lossless compression algorithm used for text which works by performing a frequency analysis and assigning bit patterns to each character based on how frequently it appears. You can find a better description on [the Huffman coding Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding).

## How do I install it?
Simply clone the repo and run `python setup.py install` to install the package. It has no dependencies, so there's no need to install any!
